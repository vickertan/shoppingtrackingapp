# Introduction

I made this project to learn how to make a Progressive Web App (PWA), which is a web app that can be installed on a mobile device and run offline by implementing a service worker. It is also designed to save the user's data locally so the user can access it anytime.

I was inspired to make this project again after finishing the Youtube course of making a PWA, and I would like to do it with additional features, functionalities, and a better design.

Check out my first PWA's repo here: [Shopping Record App Repository](https://github.com/vickertan/shoppingapp-pwa)

# Features

You can use this app to track your shopping expenses. You can add item, edit existing item, and delete it. You can also select an item as purchased, and the app will only calculate the price of unpurchased item(s).

# How to use

This project is hosted on Vercel and you can access it here:
[Shopping Tracking App](shoppingtrackingapp.vercel.app)

You will then be prompted to add it to the home screen, or you can install it from the browser menu (three dots on the top right corner).
